# Homework Assignment - Python  
Write a Python script that downloads files from the internet and saves them in a download directory.  
The list of URLs to download will be provided in a simple text file. URLs are separated by a newline. Assume that the files are small, so
downloading them does not require streaming.  

`input.txt`:

The download directory should be provided as a command line parameter.  
Consider the following and propose reasonable solutions for the following problems:  
* How to handle HTTP 404 errors?
* How to make the download process faster?
* How to display the progress of downloads?
* How to handle cancellation? (i.e., the user presses CTRL+C)  
Optional:  
* How to handle retry in case of intermittent network errors? 


# Usage
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python downloader.py`  to run for urls from urls.txt, saves to default folder 'output' in project root.  

`python downloader.py --folder <absolute path>` to run for urls from urls.txt, saves to the given folder.
